            increases illusory pattern perception, which we define as the
            identification of a coherent and meaningful interrelationship
            among a set of random or unrelated stimuli. Participants who
            lacked control were more likely to perceive a variety of illusory
            patterns, including seeing images in noise, forming illusory
            correlations in stock market information, perceiving
            conspiracies, and developing superstitions. Additionally, we
            demonstrated that increased pattern perception has a motivational
            basis by measuring the need for structure directly and showing
            that the causal link between lack of control and illusory pattern
            perception is reduced by affirming the self. Although these many
            disparate forms of pattern perception are typically discussed as
            separate phenomena, the current results suggest that there is a
            common motive underlying them. },
